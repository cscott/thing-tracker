            "title": "Direct-drive multimaterial printing on a Printrbot",
            "description": "<p>This repository contains a collection of parts used to implement\ndirect-drive multimaterial printing on a <a href=\"http://printrbot.com\">Printrbot</a> Simple Metal.\nIt should be generalizable to other Printrbot models, and other\n3d printers, but we generally use Printrbot extruder designs\nand <a href=\"http://www.marlinfw.org/\">Marlin</a>‘s <a href=\"http://reprap.org/wiki/Printrboard\">Printrboard</a>/<a href=\"http://reprap.org/wiki/Adding_more_extruders#RAMPS_using_ExtrudrBoard\">Extrudrboard</a> support.  The basic\ndirect-drive multimaterial concept is due to <a href=\"http://roemotion.com\">Brian Roe</a>\n(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MakerBrian\">@MakerBrian</a>).</p>\n<p>The direct-drive design uses the standard extruder directly above the\nhot end for precise no-lag filament control and compatibility with\nflexible filaments.  It is wired up to the extruder output on the\n<a href=\"http://reprap.org/wiki/Printrboard\">Printrboard</a> and controlled by Marlin as “Extruder 0”.</p>\n<p>We use a Printrbot <a href=\"https://printrbot.com/shop/gear-head-extruder-v2/\">Gear Head Extruder</a> for direct drive, using the\nfact that this extruder is self-loading: once filament is introduced\nabove the drive gears, the extruder will grab it and feed it through\nwithout manual intervention.  (We’re actually using the <a href=\"https://www.youmagine.com/designs/printrbot-gear-head-extruder\">beta version\nof the gear head extruder</a> which used a printed housing.)</p>\n<p>Above this direct-drive gear head extruder is a V-shaped merge adapter\nwhich accepts 1-4 bowden tubes containing different filament\nmaterials.  This is integrated with the housing of the gear head\nextruder to place the merge as close to the extruder input as\npossible.  This minimizes the distance that unsupported filament must\ntravel during filament changes, and thus (hopefully) prevents jams.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the moment I’ve designed the merge as a single printed piece which\nfits into an 8mm hole on direct-drive extruder handle or body.  The\nidea is to make it easy to retrofit an existing gear-head extruder\nby simply drilling an 8mm pocket in the handle, although I don’t\nown one of the newer Aluminum Gear Head Extruders to fully test this.</p>\n<p>The bowden tubes from the merge piece run to individual bowden drives\nmounted on filament spools.  I’m using SPANNERHANDS’ excellent\n<a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2119644\">spool design</a> with a\nslight remix to move the PFTE coupler and mount an extruder where\nthe PFTE coupler used to attach.  The extruders connect to an\n<a href=\"http://reprap.org/wiki/Adding_more_extruders#RAMPS_using_ExtrudrBoard\">Extrudrboard</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/cscott/extrudrboard2\">Extrudrboard2</a> and feed the filament from the\nspool into the bowden tube to direct it to the merge piece.\nTwo extruders are always driven simultaneously to move filament,\none on the spool and one at the print head, although during\nfilament change operations there may be times when no filament\nis actually in contact with the direct drive, and thus the\nspool extruders are working alone.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.marlinfw.org/\">Marlin</a> firmware is modified to support this style of operation,\nbuilding on the <code>MK2_MULTIPLEXER</code> support upstreamed to support Prusa’s\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/issues/29\">Super Switch</a>.</p>\n<p></p>",

I’m using the “v5 1kg” variant, but\nwith a little effort you could adapt these instructions to one of the\nother spool variants.  Use <a href=\"https://github.com/cscott/3d-multimaterial/blob/master/spool-remix-stl/spool-remix-lid2.stl\"><code>spool-remix-lid2.stl</code></a> instead of the\nstock <code>LID2</code> part.  Mount the SPANNERHANDS <code>PTFE_COUPLER_v2_0.stl</code>\npart to <a href=\"https://github.com/cscott/3d-multimaterial/blob/master/spool-remix-stl/spool-remix-lid2.stl\"><code>spool-remix-lid2.stl</code></a>.  We are going to mount our\nbowden extruder on <code>LID1</code>, where the <code>PTFE_COUPLER</code> part would\nnormally go.  Assemble the <code>LID_Bracket</code>, <code>BASE_Bracket</code>,\nand two <code>CLASP_BRACKET_v2_0</code> parts; I printed these in a contrasting\ncolor.</p>\n<p>Use two <code>Glue_Joint</code> parts to assemble the lid and base halves;\nI recommend gluing both at once with the parts assembled into a complete\ncircle so you can ensure that the gap between top and bottom is not\ntoo large as you glue them up.  Otherwise you tend to get top and bottom\nhalves which are ~178° of arc instead of 180°, and when you finally put\ntop and bottom together you get a pacman which won’t close completely.\nYou can scale up the Z axis of the SPANNERHANDS <code>Flex_Seal</code> parts and\nthen trim them into a wedge to kludge around the problem if this happens.</p>\n<p>I found the stock spool bearing mounts a little too tight, so I printed\nthe 50mm spool at 102% to fit my 52mm-core diameter spools with the right\nfit for the bearings.  I use the remix at\n<a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2372633\">thing:2372633</a> to fit my\n32mm core diameter spools; I didn’t need to scale that in any way.</p>\n<p></p>",

But if you’re buying bearings, no reason to pinch pennies.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 3:</strong>\nYou may want to try <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/walter/about\">walter</a>‘s\n<a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1052966\">remix of the gear head extruder</a>.\nIt appears to use the same Printrbot gear set and bearings—but again,\nI’m not certain whether production gears differ from beta gears, and if so\nwhich walter used.  Some modifications will be necessary to adapt his\nremix to Printrbot bottom-mounting holes, but maybe you don’t need those.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Now install the other pair of bearings into the <code>gearbox</code> piece, and\nbolt it to the base using (2) M3x20mm screws and (2) M3 nuts, sandwiching\nthe gears between them.  Before closing things up, align the set screw in\nthe left-hand gear with the channel in the base; this will allow you to\ninsert an allen wrench to tighten this gear onto the stepper shaft.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Attach the assembled gear box to the stepper.  Ensure the flat on the stepper\nshaft is aligned with the allen wrench channel.  Use (2) M3x10mm screws in\nthe top holes to attach the gear box to the stepper, and then tighten the\nset screw to secure the drive gear to the stepper shaft.</p>\n<p>You probably want to use <code>M302 P1</code> to allow cold extrudes, then hook up\nyour stepper at this point and do a test extrusion w/o filament or hot end\nin order to check that the gears turn smoothly without slipping or grinding.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Now attach the extruder to the Y-axis of your printer using (2) M3x10mm\nscrews through the bottom mounting holes into (2) M3 nuts in the slots\nprovided.  (I’m using M3x12mm screws because I have an extra 3mm aluminum\nplate mounted to my Y-axis, to support a previous dual-extruder\nexperiment <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1539380\">similar to this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Insert your hot end, and ensure it is snug and flush to the bottom surface\nfof the extruder as shown in the picture.  Any gap here will allow flexible\ncoil to kink and coil into the gap, eventually pushing your hot end off in\nthe middle of a print.  (This is the voice of experience speaking.)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Install the <code>clamp</code> piece using two M3x22mm screws into the stepper.\nThere is a ridge on the clamp piece that should fit into the ring at\nthe top of your hot end and keep it from slipping downward.  Be\ncareful of the screw length here: if the screw is too long it will\nbottom out in the blind mounting hole on the stepper and not bend the\nPLA clamp piece enough to properly grip the hotend.  (Again, the voice\nof experience.)  The <code>clamp</code> is secured to the Y-axis using another\nM3x10mm screw and M3 nut into its bottom.</p>\n<p>You can do a test print, feeding filament through the hole in\nthe top of the remixed gear head extruder, to make sure everything\nis working correctly to this point.  Be sure to use <code>M92 E127</code> to\nreset your extruder steps/mm if you weren’t previously using a\ngear head extruder.</p>\n<p></p>",

            "description": "<p>The latest revision of the <a href=\"http://reprap.org/wiki/Printrboard\">Printrboard</a> (REV F6) is mildly incompatible\nwith the original <a href=\"http://reprap.org/wiki/Adding_more_extruders#RAMPS_using_ExtrudrBoard\">Extrudrboard</a>,\nsince the HOTEND A signal used by the Extrudrboard was disconnected\nand used to provide an extruder fan output.</p>\n<p>Also, multimaterial printing doesn’t actually need all of the extra\nhotend and thermistor inputs.</p>\n<p>This repo contains a proposed “Extrudrboard2” which is compatible with\nPrintrboard REV F6 and provides up to four additional stepper outputs,\nused for multimaterial bowden extruders.  The original Printrboard\nextruder stepper is used for the direct drive just before the hotend,\nand these additional Extrudrboard outputs are multiplexed and used for\nthe individual filament options.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, I’ve thrown in a FAN2 output for owners of REV F5 and\nearlier Printrboards, which adds an extruder fan output which works\nidentically to that on the REV F6 Printrboard.</p>\n<p>The multiplexing scheme here is inspired by the “<a href=\"https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/issues/29\">Super Switch</a>“ of\nPrusa, and in fact basically the same <a href=\"http://www.marlinfw.org/\">Marlin</a> code (<code>MK2_MULTIPLEXER</code>)\ncan be used.  One wrinkle is that the Printrboard extruder output\n(we’ll call it E0) wants to be a <a href=\"https://printrbot.com/shop/gear-head-extruder-v2/\">Gear Head Extruder</a> with 127\nsteps/mm, while the individual bowden drivers (E1-E4, driven by the\nExtrudrboard2) may be the lower cost 96 steps/mm <a href=\"https://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-alu-extruder-v2/\">Alu Extruder</a>s –\nor even the short-lived injection-molded plastic extruder.  So some\nsoftware cleverness is needed to allow multiplexing different\nextruders with potentially different steps/mm rates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are two versions of the board here.  The <a href=\"https://github.com/cscott/extrudrboard2/raw/master/Extrudrboard2-thunk.sch.pdf\"><code>Extrudrboard2-thunk.sch</code></a>\nfiles are an initial\nprototype that allows you to connect two original Extrudrboards to the\nPrintrboard using the new multiplexing signal scheme.  It uses some\nrandom logic ICs for the multiplexer that I just happened to have in\nmy toolbox.  There was a three-unit minimum order, so I’ve got a couple extra.  You\ncould also order this from <a href=\"https://oshpark.com\">OSH Park</a> as shared project\n<a href=\"https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/wLrvnUeh\">wLrvnUeh</a> – warning,\nboards are not yet tested!</p>\n<p>If Printrbot decided to actually adopt this “project” as a “product”,\nthey’d want something more like <a href=\"https://github.com/cscott/extrudrboard2/raw/master/Extrudrboard2.sch.pdf\"><code>Extrudrboard2.sch</code></a>, which integrates the\nfour stepper drivers from the two old extrudrboards into a single new\nboard.  I actually reused as much as possible of the original\nExtrudrboard schematic, components, and component packages, so this\nshould be highly compatible with whatever manufacturing process\nPrintrbot had for the original Extrudrboard.</p>\n<p></p>",

Unlike the\nhodgepodge of pieces in the standard Brio/Thomas/Ikea/etc sets, track\nassembled using these pieces will always go together and fit\nperfectly.  No more frustration for you or your kids when your loops\ndon’t <em>quite</em> close up.  No more <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:661462\">flexible\ntrack</a> kludges.</p>\n<p>In addition, I’ve made adapter pieces for many popular accessories,\nsuch as those from the\n<a href=\"http://magicref.tripod.com/trains/trainhistory2.htm\">Ertl Hometown Roadway</a>,\nso that they fit into the 60-degree system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"some-discussion-of-size\">Some discussion of size</h4>\n<p>Dave Barber suggests a base radius for the system of 200mm.  The core\nhexagon will then have a diameter of 267mm and straights will be 231mm\nlong.</p>\n<p>I have instead chosen a base radius of 154mm, which makes 7 hex cells\narranged flat-to-flat measure 49 inches.  That works well with a\n<a href=\"http://wtrak.org/\">wTrak</a>-like system with 48” tables and 1” gaps between them (filled\nwith leg assemblies).  Our straights are about 7” long.</p>\n<p>For comparison, according to\n<a href=\"http://www.woodenrailway.info/track/trackguide.html\">woodenrailway.info</a>\nthe standard Brio “E” curve has a centerline radius of 202mm\nand the tighter Brio “E1” curve has a centerline radius of 110mm.\nTypical Brio straights are 4.5”, 5.5”, and 8.5”.  Our 154mm curves\nand 7” straights fit reasonably well into this family.</p>\n<p>For riser heights, although the Brio standard is 64mm, some other sets\nhave 62mm risers.  We’ve split the difference in making levels separated\nby 63mm.  This should be easily interoperable with existing pieces using\neither the 62mm or 64mm heights.</p>\n<p>We like the <a href=\"http://wtrak.org/tracks.htm\">“clickity-clack track that Learning Curve abandoned years ago”</a> so our rail pieces contain grooves for the ties\nin order to make that audible clack as trains are rolled over it.\nMost of our pieces have road on one side and rail on the other, so you\ncan play with cars or trains or both.</p>\n<p></p>",
